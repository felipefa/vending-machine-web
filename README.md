# Vending Machine Web

A simple vending machine application that allows users to sell and buy products.

## Description

This application was built as part of a coding challenge together with [vending-machine-backend](https://github.com/felipefa/vending-machine-backend).

The idea behind it is to provide a simple interface for users to interact with the vending machine.

A user can make a coin deposit and use it to buy products if they have a `buyer` role. The user can also sell and manage products if they have a `seller` role.

The application is built using the following technologies:

- [@radix-ui](https://radix-ui.com/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## How to run

Before running the application, make sure you have the [vending-machine-backend](https://github.com/felipefa/vending-machine-backend) project running on another terminal.

- Create a new `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file.


- Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

- Run the application:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
